The following files should be in this package.  The files brik.exe and
tcconfig.tc are binary files.  All other files are text files with
lines terminated by linefeeds.

Brik is believed to compile and execute in the following environments:

1.   MS-DOS 3.x, Turbo C 1.0
2.   VAX/VMS 4.7 with VAX/VMS C 2.4
3.   4.3BSD from Berkeley on a VAX-11/785
4.   Microport System V/AT version 2.2

Make sure all the needed files are in the current directory.  Then follow
instructions below for your specific type of system.  If doing so doesn't
give you a running copy of brik, read brik.h and experiment with the various
compilation options.

1.   MS-DOS, Turbo C 1.0

Use the supplied tcconfig.tc configuration file.  Load the interactive
tc.exe compiler, revise those options that are different for your
system, and compile.  I don't know if this will work with Turbo C 2.0.

2.   VAX/VMS

2.1.   If you have DEC's make utility called "mms", proceed as follows:

     a.   Delete "makefile" so mms won't get confused
     b.   Type "mms" at the VMS prompt
     c.   If all goes well, mms will compile and link the necessary files,
          ending by creating "brik.exe" in the current directory.
     d.   Move "brik.exe" wherever you want it and define a symbol with
          a command line of the following type:

               $ brik :== $my$disk:[bindir]brik.exe

         where my$disk is the name of your device and bindir is the name
         of the directory in which "brik.exe" is kept.

2.2.  If you don't have "mms", use the command file supplied.  Invoke it as:

     $ @makebrik

When it exits, brik.exe should have been created in your current
directory, and the symbol "brik" should also have been defined for
you.  If you move brik.exe to another directory be sure to redefine the
symbol "brik" correctly as described above in part I.

Be sure to read the section in the manul on VAX/VMS bugs.

3.   4.xBSD

Invoke the script "mkbsd" with the command "sh mkbsd".  Finally move
the program "brik" into an appropriate directory and make sure that
that directory is in your execution search path.

4.   System V

Invoke the script "mksysv" (for generic System V) or "mkuport" (for
Microport System V/AT) with the command "sh mksysv" or "sh mkuport".
The "mkuport" script will try to move the compiled "brik" into
/usr/local/bin/brik so revise it if you don't want this done.  The
"mksysv" script will create "brik" in the current directory ready to be
moved to an appropriate directory in your search path.

The "mkuport" script compiles brik using the large memory model,
because an unexpected bug in Microport System V/AT made all my small-
model libraries vanish and I haven't had a chance to restore them from
backups.  I suspect compiling in the small memory model will work.
